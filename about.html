        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Hemanth, a passionate and motivated learner with a strong
          interest in software development, web technologies, and machine
          learning. I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems and
          continuously improving my technical and problem-solving skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have hands-on experience with Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and Flask,
          and I’ve worked on projects like GrainPalette (Rice Classification
          using Deep Learning) and other machine learning and web-based
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always eager to explore new technologies, improve my coding
          skills, and grow as a developer. My goal is to become a skilled
          software engineer and contribute to impactful projects in the tech
          industry.
        </p>
